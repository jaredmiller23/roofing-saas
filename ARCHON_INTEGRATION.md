# Archon Integration for Roofing SaaS Project

## What is Archon?
Archon is our centralized knowledge base and task management system for this project. It provides:
- **Knowledge Management**: Stores all project documentation with RAG-powered search
- **Task Tracking**: Manages our 20-week phased implementation
- **MCP Server**: Allows Claude Code to access project context consistently

## Quick Access
- **UI**: http://localhost:3737
- **MCP Server**: http://localhost:8051
- **API Server**: http://localhost:8181

## How Claude Code Instances Should Use Archon

### 1. On Session Start
```bash
# Check if Archon is running
cd /Users/ccai/archon && docker compose ps

# If not running, start it
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Query Knowledge Base
Use MCP tools to search for:
- Implementation details
- API documentation
- Project requirements
- Technical specifications

### 3. Task Management
- Check current phase tasks in Archon
- Mark tasks as in-progress when starting
- Update task status as completed
- Add notes or blockers to tasks

### 4. Documentation Updates
When creating new documentation:
1. Save to project folder first
2. Upload to Archon Knowledge Base
3. Tag appropriately for searchability

## Troubleshooting

### If Archon is not accessible:
```bash
# Restart Archon
cd /Users/ccai/archon
docker compose down
docker compose up -d

# Check logs
docker compose logs -f
```

### If MCP connection fails:
- Verify port 8051 is accessible
- Check Archon MCP service is healthy
- Review connection configuration in Claude Code

## Important Notes

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Archon is the authoritative source for project documentation and tasks
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep tasks and documentation current in Archon
3. **Cross-Session Consistency**: All Claude instances should reference Archon for context
4. **Phased Approach**: Strictly follow the phases - don't jump ahead

## Integration Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All Claude instances work from the same knowledge base
2. **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility of what's done and what's next
3. **Context Preservation**: No loss of context between sessions
4. **Smart Search**: RAG-powered search finds relevant information quickly
5. **Real-time Updates**: Changes are immediately available to all users

Remember: Archon ensures that whether it's you or any Claude instance working on this project, everyone has the same context and is working toward the same goals.
