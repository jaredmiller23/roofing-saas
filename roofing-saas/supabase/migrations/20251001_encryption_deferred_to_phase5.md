# Token Encryption - Deferred to Phase 5

## Why Deferred

The token encryption migration (`20251001_enable_pgsodium_encryption.sql`) requires:
- Superuser permissions to access `pgsodium.valid_key`
- Complex integration between Supabase Vault and pgsodium
- Service role API access (not available in SQL Editor)

## Current Security (Adequate for Phase 1)

✅ **Row-Level Security (RLS)** - Tokens isolated by tenant
✅ **SSL/TLS** - All connections encrypted in transit
✅ **PostgreSQL Auth** - Strong authentication
✅ **Token Expiration** - Access tokens expire in 1 hour
✅ **Refresh Token Rotation** - 100-day expiration

## Phase 5 Implementation Plan

In Phase 5 (Financial Integration), we'll implement proper encryption:

1. **Application-level encryption** using Node.js crypto
2. **Supabase Vault integration** via service role API
3. **Key rotation strategy** for long-term security
4. **Encryption for all sensitive data** (not just QB tokens)

## What to Do Now

1. Deploy only the **performance indexes migration**
2. Continue development with current security
3. Plan proper encryption architecture in Phase 5

**Date Deferred**: October 1, 2025
**Reason**: Complexity vs. benefit for MVP
**Security Assessment**: Current security adequate for Phase 1
