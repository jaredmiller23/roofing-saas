# Roofing Industry Terminology

**Purpose**: Standard industry terms used in roofing business
**Audience**: Claude (for accurate feature development)
**Last Updated**: November 17, 2025

## 📏 Measurement Terms

**Square**
- Unit of measurement: 100 square feet
- Example: "20 square roof" = 2,000 sq ft
- Pricing is typically "per square" (e.g., $350/square)

**Pitch**
- Roof slope measurement: rise over run
- Format: X/12 (e.g., "6/12 pitch" = 6" rise per 12" run)
- Low pitch: 2/12 - 4/12 (walkable)
- Medium pitch: 5/12 - 7/12 (standard)
- Steep pitch: 8/12+ (requires safety equipment, more labor)

**Square Footage**
- Total roof area measured in sq ft
- Calculation: length × width (for each plane) + overhangs
- Tools: Measuring tape, drones, satellite imagery

## 🏗️ Roofing Materials

**Shingles**
- Asphalt shingles: Most common residential (90%+)
- Architectural shingles: Thicker, premium look, 25-30 year warranty
- 3-tab shingles: Budget option, 15-20 year warranty
- Designer shingles: High-end, 40-50 year warranty

**Underlayment**
- Protective layer under shingles
- Felt (tar paper): Traditional, budget option
- Synthetic: Modern, better waterproofing, longer lasting
- Ice & water shield: Required in valleys, eaves in cold climates

**Flashing**
- Metal strips for waterproofing at joints
- **Step flashing**: Along walls, chimneys
- **Valley flashing**: Where two roof planes meet
- **Drip edge**: Along eaves and rakes
- **Pipe boots**: Around vent pipes

**Decking**
- Wooden boards under roofing material
- Plywood or OSB (oriented strand board)
- May need replacement if water-damaged

## 🏠 Roof Components

**Ridge**
- Highest point where two roof planes meet at the top
- **Ridge cap**: Special shingles that cover the ridge

**Valley**
- Where two roof planes meet at an angle (forms a "V")
- High water flow area, needs extra waterproofing

**Eave**
- Lower edge of the roof (where gutters attach)
- Overhangs the wall

**Rake**
- Sloped edge of a gabled roof (the diagonal edge)

**Gable**
- Triangular wall section under a peaked roof
- "Gabled roof" = two slopes meeting at a ridge

**Hip**
- External angle where two roof planes meet (not a valley)
- "Hip roof" = slopes on all four sides

**Soffit**
- Underside of the roof overhang
- Often has vents for attic ventilation

**Fascia**
- Vertical board along the roof edge (where gutters mount)

**Chimney**
- Requires special flashing, adds complexity and labor

**Skylight**
- Window in the roof
- Adds complexity, potential leak point

## 🛠️ Installation Terms

**Tear-Off**
- Removing old roofing material before installation
- "Full tear-off" = remove everything to decking
- Alternative: "Overlay" (install new shingles over old - not recommended)

**Inspection**
- Initial assessment of roof condition
- Photo documentation of damage
- Measurements for estimate

**Slope**
- Same as pitch (how steep the roof is)

**Starter Strips**
- First row of shingles at the eave
- Provides proper seal for bottom edge

**Ventilation**
- Ridge vents, soffit vents, gable vents
- Important for attic temperature, prevents ice dams
- Code requirements vary by location

**Nail Pattern**
- How many nails per shingle and where placed
- Critical for warranty compliance

## 💼 Business/Sales Terms

**Lead**
- Potential customer (contact info, damage type, address)
