## üö® Known Limitations

1. **Workflow Delays**: Currently uses `setTimeout` for delays. In production, should use a job queue (Bull, BullMQ, or Supabase Edge Functions with pg_cron).

2. **Email Domain**: Using `notifications.claimclarityai.com` - need to verify domain in Resend and add DNS records for production.

3. **Webhook Validation**: Twilio webhook signature validation is commented out. Should enable in production for security.

4. **Rate Limiting**: Basic rate limiting implemented (100ms between SMS). May need adjustment based on usage.

5. **Template UI**: No frontend UI for creating templates yet. Must use API directly.

---

## üéØ Phase 3 Prerequisites

Before starting Phase 3 (Mobile PWA), ensure:

1. ‚úÖ All Phase 2 database migrations run
2. ‚è≥ At least one communication feature tested (SMS recommended)
3. ‚è≥ Webhooks configured (can use ngrok for local testing)
4. ‚è≥ Analytics API verified working

**Optional but Recommended:**
- Create 2-3 test workflows
- Test email domain verification in Resend
- Review Twilio console for SMS/call logs

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### SMS not sending?
1. Check Twilio credentials in `.env.local`
2. Verify phone number format (E.164: +1234567890)
3. Check Twilio console for error messages
4. Verify contact hasn't opted out

### Email not sending?
1. Verify Resend API key is valid
2. Check from email domain is verified
3. Test with Resend's test domain first
4. Check Resend dashboard for delivery logs

### Webhooks not working?
1. Verify webhook URL is publicly accessible (use ngrok)
2. Check Twilio/Resend dashboard webhook logs
3. Verify webhook endpoints return 200 status
4. Check application logs for errors

### Workflows not executing?
1. Verify workflow is active (`is_active: true`)
2. Check trigger type matches event
3. Review `workflow_executions` table for errors
4. Check `workflow_step_executions` for step failures

## üíæ Database Backup Recommendation

Before deploying to production:
1. Export current schema: `pg_dump` from Supabase
2. Test migrations on a staging database
3. Verify RLS policies are working
4. Test with multiple tenants

## ‚ú® What's Next: Phase 3

**Phase 3: Mobile PWA (Weeks 10-12)**

Focus areas:
1. PWA configuration (service worker, manifest)
2. Photo upload system (Supabase Storage)
3. Offline capabilities (IndexedDB caching)
4. Territory management for door-knocking
5. Gamification system (points, achievements, leaderboards)
