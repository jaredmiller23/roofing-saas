## 13. Data Migration Plan

### Step 1: Full Project Re-Export from Proline
**Action Required**: Request complete data export from Proline
- All 1,391 projects (not just 556)
- All fields including portal URLs, adjuster names, etc.
- Include archived/deleted projects
- Export format: CSV or JSON

### Step 2: Export Additional Entities
- Organizations (if any exist)
- Files metadata (file names, types, upload dates)
  - Actual files may need manual download
- Tasks (if accessible via export)
- Events/Appointments
- Call logs (if tracked)

### Step 3: Supplemental Data Collection
For missing data not in exports:
- Document current file organization structure
- Interview client about file naming conventions
- Identify which files are critical vs archival

### Step 4: Phased Import Strategy

**Immediate** (this week):
- Re-import all 1,391 projects with complete field mapping
- Create organizations table and import any org data
- Link existing contacts to organizations where applicable

**Phase 2** (Communication Hub):
- Import call logs if available
- Set up Twilio and start fresh call logging

**Phase 3** (Mobile PWA):
- Import file metadata
- Client team uploads critical files to new system
- Older files remain in Proline for reference (6-month overlap)

---

## 14. Client Communication Recommendations

### Immediate Discussion Topics

1. **Data Completeness**
   - "We found 1,391 projects in Proline but only imported 556. We need access to export the complete dataset including BILLING, CLOSED, and archived projects."

2. **File Migration**
   - "Proline contains project photos and documents. We need to plan how to migrate these. Options:
     - Manual re-upload of critical files
     - API export (if Proline supports)
     - 6-month overlap period where both systems are accessible"

3. **Jobs vs Projects**
   - "Proline separates 'Projects' (sales) from 'Jobs' (production). Should we implement the same separation? This affects crew scheduling and workflow."

4. **Organizations**
   - "Do you work with property managers or real estate agents who refer multiple projects? We can build an Organizations module to track these relationships."

5. **Timeline Adjustment**
   - "Based on the feature gap analysis, we recommend extending Phase 1 by 1 week to add Organizations and Tasks, and enhancing Phase 3 to include the Jobs module and file uploads."

### Feature Prioritization Session

Schedule 1-hour call to review:
- Priority Matrix (Critical vs Nice-to-Have)
- Timeline impact of adding features
- Budget implications
- Which Proline features they actually use daily vs rarely

---

## 15. Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items

1. **Incomplete Data Migration**
   - **Risk**: Client discovers missing projects after Proline subscription ends
   - **Mitigation**: Complete data audit and re-import before Phase 2
   - **Timeline**: 3-5 days for full re-import and validation

2. **File Storage Costs**
   - **Risk**: 1,000s of photos could exceed Supabase free tier
   - **Mitigation**: Estimate file count and sizes, budget for storage tier
   - **Action**: Survey Proline file counts before migration

3. **Feature Expectations**
   - **Risk**: Client expects all Proline features on day 1
   - **Mitigation**: Clear feature roadmap with phase delivery
   - **Action**: Review this report with client for alignment

4. **Jobs Module Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Production workflow more complex than anticipated
   - **Mitigation**: Detailed workflow mapping with client
   - **Action**: Schedule session to document current job scheduling process

### Medium Risk Items

5. **Call Recording Compliance**
   - **Risk**: Legal requirements for call recording vary by state
   - **Mitigation**: Research Tennessee 1-party vs 2-party consent laws
   - **Action**: Add consent disclosure to dialer UI

6. **E-Signing Integration**
   - **Risk**: DocuSign pricing may be expensive for small teams
   - **Mitigation**: Evaluate alternatives (SignRequest, PandaDoc, HelloSign)
   - **Action**: Get pricing quotes during Phase 4

## 18. Conclusion

Proline is a comprehensive CRM system with 10+ years of roofing industry refinement. The client uses significantly more features than initially apparent from the CSV export. Key discoveries:

**Critical Gaps**:
1. 835 missing projects (60% of data not imported)
2. No file management (client needs mobile photos)
3. No jobs/production system (separate from sales)
4. No organizations (business client tracking)
5. No call logging (client uses phone heavily)

**Recommended Approach**:
- Extend Phase 1 by 1 week to add Organizations and Tasks
- Enhance Phase 2 with call logging and recording
- Expand Phase 3 to include Jobs module and file uploads
- Re-import complete dataset before proceeding past Phase 1

**Timeline Impact**:
- Original: 16-18 weeks
- Revised: 18-20 weeks (accounting for discovered scope)
- Still faster than original 22-week estimate

**Client Value**:
Despite additional scope, the new system will match or exceed Proline's functionality while adding:
- Modern mobile-first design
- AI voice assistant (differentiator)
- QuickBooks integration (not in Proline)
- Better performance (vs slow Bubble.io platform)
- Customizable to their specific workflow

This exploration has been invaluable in identifying gaps early, before they become post-launch issues. Recommend proceeding with phased approach and clear client communication about discovered requirements.
