---

## 12. Cost Considerations

### Enzy Pricing (Estimate)
- **Unknown exact pricing** (not public)
- Typical field sales gamification platforms: $20-50/user/month
- **56 active reps** √ó $30/month = $1,680/month = $20,160/year

### Additional Costs in Our System
- **Google Maps API**: ~$200-500/month (with usage limits)
- **Weather API**: NOAA (free) or commercial ($100-300/month)
- **Supabase Storage**: Photos from field (~$50-100/month)

**Total Savings by Replacing Enzy**: ~$15,000-20,000/year
**New Platform Costs**: ~$5,000-10,000/year
**Net Savings**: ~$10,000/year

---

## 13. Risk Assessment

### High Risk

1. **Map Performance on Mobile**
   - **Risk**: Google Maps can be slow on poor connections
   - **Mitigation**: Implement tile caching, offline map support

2. **GPS Battery Drain**
   - **Risk**: All-day GPS tracking kills phone battery
   - **Mitigation**: Configurable tracking intervals, low-power mode

3. **Offline Sync Conflicts**
   - **Risk**: Two reps knock same house while offline
   - **Mitigation**: Last-write-wins with conflict UI, unique address validation

4. **User Adoption (Switching from Enzy)**
   - **Risk**: Field reps resist change from familiar Enzy app
   - **Mitigation**: Replicate Enzy UX patterns, extensive training, phased rollout

### Medium Risk

5. **Weather Data Accuracy**
   - **Risk**: NOAA data may not match Enzy's commercial provider
   - **Mitigation**: Cross-reference multiple sources, allow manual overrides

6. **Complex Territory Drawing**
   - **Risk**: Polygon drawing on mobile is difficult
   - **Mitigation**: Desktop admin tool for territory creation, mobile view-only

---

## 14. Enzy Strengths to Emulate

### UX Patterns Worth Copying

1. **Gamification-First Design**
   - Make leaderboards prominent
   - Celebrate achievements in-app
   - Use friendly competition language

## 18. Conclusion

Enzy is a **highly specialized door-knocking and field sales gamification platform** that the client uses to motivate and track their 56-person field team. The platform drives measurable results (27% sales increase during competitions, 180+ daily interactions).

**Critical Discovery**: Enzy is **TOP OF FUNNEL** (lead generation), while Proline is **MID/BOTTOM OF FUNNEL** (sales pipeline). To fully replace both systems, we MUST add:

1. **Map-based territory management** üî¥ CRITICAL
2. **Mobile knock capture workflow** üî¥ CRITICAL
3. **Weather maps** üü° HIGH (roofing-specific value)
4. **Customer survey + review gating** üü° HIGH (170% more reviews)
5. **Competition creation UI** üü° MEDIUM

**Recommended Approach**: **Option A - Full Replacement**
- Extend Phase 3 by 1 week (6 weeks total)
- Add customer surveys in Week 9 (parallel with Phase 3 start)
- Deliver unified Proline + Enzy replacement by Week 20
- Net savings: ~$10,000/year, single platform to maintain

**Timeline Impact**: 20 weeks (2 weeks longer than enhanced estimate, but 2 weeks faster than original 22-week baseline)

**Client Value**:
- Eliminate $20K/year Enzy cost
- Single unified platform (no data sync issues)
- Better integration (CRM + Canvassing in one app)
- AI Voice Assistant differentiator (Enzy doesn't have)
- Custom roofing workflow (not generic field sales)

This exploration reveals that our project scope should expand slightly to include Enzy replacement features, ensuring the client can sunset BOTH legacy systems and run their entire business on our platform.
