## üîß Technical Implementation Highlights

### Advanced Database Features

**Auto-generated Values**:
- Job numbers with year prefix (YY-####)
- Survey tokens and unique links
- QR code URL generation

**Calculated Fields**:
- Total job cost (labor + materials + equipment + other) - GENERATED column
- Actual duration hours (calculated from start/end timestamps)
- Response time for surveys

**Trigger-based Automation**:
- Auto-update `updated_at` timestamps (8 tables)
- Auto-set `completed_at` when status changes to 'completed'
- Auto-increment territory knock counts
- Review gating logic (4-5 stars ‚Üí public review, 1-3 ‚Üí internal feedback)
- Event time validation

**Helper Functions Created** (15+):
- `get_user_call_metrics()` - Call statistics by user
- `get_contact_call_count()` - Call count per contact
- `get_user_knock_stats()` - Knock statistics and conversion rates
- `get_knocks_within_radius()` - Spatial queries for territory coverage
- `get_crew_member_jobs()` - Jobs by crew member
- `get_crew_lead_stats()` - Performance metrics for crew leads

- `upcoming_jobs` - Future scheduled jobs
- `todays_events` - Today's calendar events
- `upcoming_events` - Next 50 upcoming events
- `pending_review_requests` - 4-5 star surveys awaiting public review
- `negative_feedback_alerts` - Low-rated surveys needing manager attention
- `active_territories` - Active territories with assigned reps
- `knock_appointments` - Knocks that resulted in appointments
- `knock_follow_ups` - Interested prospects needing follow-up

### Security & Performance

**Row Level Security (RLS)**:
- All tables have 4 RLS policies (view, create, update, delete)
- Multi-tenant isolation via `tenant_id`
- Special policy for public survey submission via token

**Indexes**:
- Standard indexes on foreign keys and commonly queried fields
- Composite indexes for complex queries (crew scheduling, calendar views)
- GIN indexes for array fields (attendees, crew_members, tags)
- Partial indexes for specific use cases (active jobs, pending reminders)
- Spatial indexes for geographic queries (knock coordinates, territory centers)

**Soft Deletes**:
- All tables use `is_deleted` flag instead of hard deletes
- Maintains data integrity and audit trail

## üí° Key Insights

### Database Design Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Jobs table separate from Projects
   - Projects = sales/estimates
   - Jobs = production/installation
   - Prevents mixing sales and production workflows

2. **Review Gating**: Intelligent survey routing
   - 4-5 stars ‚Üí prompt for public Google review
   - 1-3 stars ‚Üí internal feedback, manager alert
   - Maximizes positive reviews, prevents negative public feedback

3. **Token-based Public Access**: Surveys accessible without auth
   - Unique survey tokens for customer access
   - QR codes for mobile scanning
   - Reduces friction for customer feedback

4. **Geographic Features**: Support for map-based workflows
   - GeoJSON boundaries for territories (can upgrade to PostGIS)
   - GPS coordinates with accuracy tracking
   - Spatial queries for coverage analysis

5. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive tracking
   - Soft deletes maintain history
   - Created/updated timestamps
   - Created_by user references
   - Change tracking via triggers

### Performance Optimizations

- Composite indexes for multi-column queries
- Partial indexes for filtered queries (WHERE clauses)
- GIN indexes for array containment searches
- Generated columns for calculated values (avoid runtime computation)
- Views for complex joins (pre-optimized queries)
