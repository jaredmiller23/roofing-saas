# Phase 3 Preparation: Mobile PWA

**Start Date**: Ready to begin
**Duration**: Weeks 10-12 (3 weeks)
**Focus**: Progressive Web App with offline capabilities, photo uploads, and gamification

---

## üéØ Phase 3 Goals

Transform the Roofing SaaS into a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) that replaces the Enzy door-knocking app currently used by the client.

### Key Requirements (from PRD):
1. **Mobile-First Design**: Works seamlessly on phones and tablets
2. **Offline Capability**: Door-knockers can work without internet
3. **Photo Uploads**: Document roof conditions and job progress
4. **Territory Management**: Assign and track door-knocking zones
5. **Gamification**: Points, achievements, and leaderboards for sales reps

## üóÑÔ∏è New Database Tables (Already Created!)

These tables exist from Phase 1 schema - just need to use them:

### Territories
```sql
territories (
  id, tenant_id, name, description,
  boundary_data (GeoJSON), assigned_to,
  created_at, updated_at, is_deleted
)
```

### Photos
```sql
photos (
  id, tenant_id, contact_id, project_id,
  file_path, file_url, thumbnail_url,
  metadata (JSONB), uploaded_by,
  created_at, is_deleted
)
```

### Gamification Tables
```sql
-- Points tracking
gamification_points (
  id, tenant_id, user_id, action_type,
  points, metadata, created_at
)

-- User stats
gamification_stats (
  id, tenant_id, user_id,
  total_points, level, rank,
  achievements (JSONB),
  updated_at
)

-- Achievements
gamification_achievements (
  id, tenant_id, name, description,
  icon, points_required, badge_type,
  created_at
)
```

```

---

---

## üöÄ PWA Configuration

### 1. next.pwa Setup
```javascript
// next.config.js
const withPWA = require('next-pwa')({
  dest: 'public',
  register: true,
  skipWaiting: true,
  disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
})

module.exports = withPWA({
  // existing config
})
```

### 2. Manifest File
```json
// public/manifest.json
{
  "name": "Roofing SaaS",
  "short_name": "Roofing",
  "description": "Complete roofing CRM and sales tool",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#3b82f6",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Service Worker Strategy
- **Network First**: API calls, always try network
- **Cache First**: Static assets (JS, CSS, images)
- **Stale While Revalidate**: Contact/project lists
- **Background Sync**: Photo uploads when back online

---

## üì± Offline Strategy

### What Works Offline:
- View cached contacts and projects
- Take photos (stored locally)
- Create new contacts (queued for sync)
- View territories and assignments
- Check leaderboards (cached data)

### What Syncs When Online:
- New contacts created offline
- Photos taken offline
- Points earned offline
- Activity logs

### Implementation:
```typescript
// IndexedDB stores:
- contacts (last synced data)
- projects (last synced data)
- pending_uploads (photos to upload)
- pending_actions (create/update operations)
- sync_queue (ordered operations)
```

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Mobile Testing**: Phase 3 requires testing on actual mobile devices, not just browser dev tools

2. **Photo Storage**: Supabase has storage limits. May need to configure image compression and quality settings

3. **Offline Sync**: Complex! Need careful handling of conflicts when syncing offline changes

4. **iOS PWA Limitations**: iOS Safari has some PWA limitations (no push notifications, limited storage)

5. **Map Data**: Territory boundaries may require GeoJSON. Consider using simple polygon coordinates initially
