# PRD Gap Analysis Report

**Date**: September 29, 2025
**Purpose**: Identify discrepancies between PRD requirements and available knowledge/tools

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL GAPS - Must Address Before Starting

### 1. **Call Recording Implementation**
- **PRD Requirement**: "Call recording" (explicit client requirement)
- **Current Status**: ‚ùå NO implementation details in knowledge base
- **Impact**: This is a MUST-HAVE feature per client
- **Recommendation**:
  - Research Twilio's call recording API
  - Consider compliance requirements (two-party consent in Tennessee)
  - May need additional service like Aircall or CallRail

### 2. **E-Signing Integration**
- **PRD Requirement**: "E-signing" (explicit client requirement)
- **Current Status**: ‚ùå NO implementation details found
- **Mentioned**: Brief reference to "DocuSign API or simpler alternative" in PRD
- **Impact**: Critical for contract management
- **Recommendation**:
  - Need to research DocuSign API costs and complexity
  - Consider alternatives: HelloSign (Dropbox Sign), PandaDoc, or SignWell
  - Add implementation guide to knowledge base

### 3. **Voice/RAG Agent Details**
- **PRD Requirement**: "RAG voice agent (executive assistant)"
- **Current Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Generic RAG mentioned, but no voice specifics
- **Knowledge Base**: Has Whisper/TTS code examples but not integrated
- **Recommendation**:
  - Need clear implementation plan for voice input/output
  - Consider using Web Speech API initially (simpler than Whisper)
  - Define what "executive assistant" means in practice

---

## üü° MODERATE GAPS - Important but Manageable

### 4. **Reporting System**
- **PRD Requirement**: "Reporting" (client requirement)
- **Current Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Vague - no specific report types defined
- **Impact**: Need clarity on what reports are needed
- **Recommendation**:
  - Define specific reports: P&L, job costing, crew performance
  - Consider using Supabase views for simple reporting
  - Maybe integrate with QuickBooks reporting

### 5. **Gamification Details**
- **PRD Requirement**: Replace Enzy's gamification
- **Current Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic mention but no implementation details
- **Knowledge Base**: Simple schema but no logic
- **Recommendation**:
  - Define point system rules
  - Create leaderboard queries
  - Plan achievement/badge system

### 6. **PWA Implementation**
- **PRD Requirement**: "PWA using next-pwa"
- **Current Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Mentioned but no setup instructions
- **Knowledge Base**: Has service worker examples but not Next.js specific
- **Recommendation**:
  - Add next-pwa setup guide
  - Define offline capabilities needed
  - Plan caching strategy

---

## üü¢ AVAILABLE BUT NOT INTEGRATED

### 7. **Existing Resources Not Leveraged**
- **Postgres MCP**: Could help with database optimization
- **Archon**: ‚úÖ Already integrated for knowledge/tasks
- **Local AI Package**: Has Supabase docker setup we could reference

---

## üìã RECOMMENDATIONS BEFORE PHASE 1

### Immediate Actions Needed:

1. **Research & Document E-Signing Options**
   - Cost comparison: DocuSign vs alternatives
   - Implementation complexity
   - Add to knowledge base

2. **Define Call Recording Architecture**
   - Twilio capabilities and costs
   - Storage requirements (Supabase Storage?)
   - Compliance considerations

3. **Clarify Reporting Requirements**
   - Get specific report examples from client
   - Define data visualization needs
   - Consider if we need a reporting library

4. **Detail Voice Assistant Scope**
   - What queries should it handle?
   - Voice-only or voice + text?
   - Real-time or async responses?

### Consider Adjusting Timeline:

**Current Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)** might be optimistic given these gaps:
- E-signing integration complexity unknown
- Call recording requires research
- Voice agent in Phase 4 but client expects it

**Suggestion**:
- Add 1 week for research/planning before coding
- Move some "must-haves" earlier in timeline

## üö® RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Risk Items:
1. **Call Recording** - Legal compliance + technical complexity
2. **E-Signing** - Third-party dependency, potential cost
3. **Voice Agent** - Client expectation vs Phase 4 timeline

### Medium Risk:
1. **PWA Offline Capability** - Complex for data sync
2. **Gamification** - Needs careful design to be engaging

### Low Risk:
1. **Basic CRM** - Well understood, good examples
2. **QuickBooks** - API documented
3. **SMS/Email** - Straightforward with Twilio/Resend

## ‚úÖ NEXT STEPS

1. **Get Client Clarification On**:
   - Specific reporting needs
   - Voice assistant use cases
   - Call recording requirements (all calls or selective?)

2. **Research & Add to Knowledge Base**:
   - E-signing API comparison
   - Twilio call recording setup
   - Next-pwa configuration

3. **Consider Adding MCP Servers**:
   - Postgres MCP for database optimization
   - Maybe create custom MCP for roofing-specific operations

4. **Update PRD With**:
   - More detailed technical specifications
   - Specific third-party service choices
   - Revised timeline if needed

## üìä READINESS SCORE

**Overall Readiness**: 65/100

- ‚úÖ Infrastructure/Stack: 90% ready
- ‚úÖ Database/Auth: 85% ready
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Communication Features: 50% ready
- ‚ùå E-Signing: 20% ready
- ‚ùå Call Recording: 10% ready
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Voice Assistant: 40% ready

**Recommendation**: Spend 2-3 days researching and documenting the gaps before starting Phase 1 development.
