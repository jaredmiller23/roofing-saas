## üí° Best Practices & Patterns

### 1. Always Research Before Implementing

**Bad Pattern** (Old Way):
```markdown
1. Start implementing feature
2. Hit roadblock
3. Research solution
4. Refactor implementation
5. Hit another roadblock
6. Research again
7. Refactor again
```

**Good Pattern** (New Way):
```markdown
1. Launch subagent for comprehensive research
2. Review findings
3. Implement with optimal patterns
4. Success on first attempt
```

### 2. Use Checkpoints for Experiments

**Bad Pattern**:
```markdown
1. Implement approach A
2. Realize it won't work
3. Comment out code
4. Try approach B
5. Breaks something
6. Hard to revert cleanly
```

**Good Pattern**:
```markdown
1. Implement approach A
   üìç Checkpoint
2. Test - doesn't meet requirements
3. Esc√ó2 to rewind
4. Implement approach B
   üìç Checkpoint
5. Test - exceeds requirements ‚úì
```

### 3. Execute in Parallel Whenever Possible

**Opportunities**:
- Research multiple topics
- Build API + UI simultaneously
- Test multiple scenarios
- Run validation while developing
- Deploy staging + update docs

**Rule of Thumb**:
If tasks don't depend on each other ‚Üí Do in parallel

### 4. Leverage 30-Hour Sprints Strategically

**Good Candidates**:
- Complex multi-component features
- Features with many integration points
- Features requiring optimization
- Features with high interdependency

**Not Good Candidates**:
- Simple CRUD operations
- Single-file changes
- Quick bug fixes
- Minor UI tweaks
